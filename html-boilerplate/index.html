    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a sample HTML document.</p>
    <p>I want to use this opportunity to understand how <strong>strong</strong> element works in HTML and to be able to differentiate it from the <b>b</b> element</p>
    <p>The <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> element is used to indicate that the text it contains is of strong importance or urgency. It is a semantic element, meaning it conveys meaning about the content to both browsers and assistive technologies like screen readers. When rendered, text within a &lt;strong&gt; tag is typically displayed in bold by default, but the emphasis is on its importance rather than just its appearance.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the &lt;b&gt; element is used purely for visual styling, specifically to make text bold. It does not carry any semantic meaning or importance. The &lt;b&gt; tag is often used when you want to draw attention to text without implying that it is more important than the surrounding content.</p>
    <p>In summary, use <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> when you want to indicate that text is important, and use <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> when you simply want to make text bold for visual emphasis without adding any semantic meaning.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Here is an example of both elements in use:</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This action cannot be undone!</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> This is just a stylistic choice.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Another element close to it is the <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong> element</p>
    <p>The <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong> element is used to indicate emphasis on a particular word or phrase within a sentence. It is also a semantic element, meaning it conveys meaning about the content to both browsers and assistive technologies like screen readers. When rendered, text within an &lt;em&gt; tag is typically displayed in italics by default, but the emphasis is on the stress or importance of the text rather than just its appearance.</p>
    <p>On the other hand the <strong>&lt;i&gt;</strong> element is used purely for visual styling, specifically to make text italicized. It does not carry any semantic meaning or importance. The &lt;i&gt; tag is often used when you want to draw attention to text without implying that it is more important than the surrounding content.</p>
    <p>In summary, use <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong> when you want to indicate that text should be emphasized, and use <b>&lt;i&gt;</b> when you simply want to make text italic for visual emphasis without adding any semantic meaning.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Element:</strong> Indicates strong importance or urgency.</li>

        <li><em>Em Element:</em> Indicates emphasis on a word or phrase, typically rendered in italics.</li>
        <li><i>I Element:</i> Used for visual styling, making text italicized without semantic meaning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How and when to use the elements</h2>
    <p>Here are some guidelines on how and when to use these elements</p>
    <p>Use the elements as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong></strong> for important text.</li>
        <li><b>Use <b>&lt;b&gt;</b></b> for bold text without importance.</li>
        <li><em>Use <em>&lt;em&gt;</em></em> for emphasized text.</li>
